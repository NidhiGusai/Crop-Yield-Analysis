# Crop-Yield-Analysis

Introduction 
The agriculture industry is changing in recent years due to technological and data analytics breakthroughs, which are enabling data-driven problem solving of real-time issues. Crop yield prediction is one of the key areas where advanced technologies are applied. Based on yield estimates, farmers, the national food security department, policy makers, and stockholders can make educated judgments. It also oversees the best use of resources and the reduction of production-related risks in agriculture.
